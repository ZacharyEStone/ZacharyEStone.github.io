	<h2>Conference Papers</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>‘From England to Eyjafjallajökull via Vercelli: The Curious Past of Vercelli MS 225,’ New Chaucer Society Conference, Rejykjavik, Iceland, 18 July 2014. 
			<br>This paper takes a long view of the history of a specific manuscript, Vercelli MS 225, from production to scholarly rediscovery in 2011 in order to historicize the ways in which manuscripts can and are used at various times.</li> 
			<li>‘This is not a Lollard Book,’ International Medieval Congress, Kalamazoo, MI, 10 May 2014. 
			<br>This paper focuses on the ways in which a specific manuscript, Bodley 131, attempts to confront Lollard objections to contemporary religious practice.  I argue that while Bodley 131 clearly does not intend to be a Lollard book, it resorts to textual strategies and production assumptions basic to Lollard textual production and use.</li>
			<li>‘Devout and Diverse “Ymaginacions”: Nicholas Love and the Mirror of History,’ International Medieval Congress, Kalamazoo, MI, 10 May 2013.  
			<br>This paper explored the ways in which Nicholas Love historicized his translation project and how he attempted to moralize history in such a way as to challenge Lollard ideas about secular dominion.</li>
			<li>'Truthiness: The Facsimulacrumization of Medieval Books and the Problems of Unintended Consequences,' at Northeast Modern Language Association Conference, Boston, 21-24 March 2013. 
			<br>This paper wrestles with the potential and problems inherent in the production and use of digital facsimiles by scholars of medieval books. My argument attempts to both assert the primacy of the physical object while simultaneously meditating on the ways in which digital textuality might mirror pre-print models and what such a synchronicity might mean for historians of the book.</li>
			<li>'Quod John Morton: Anthologizing Nicholas Love in the North,' at 'Out of Bounds: Mobility, Movement and Use of Manuscripts and Printed Books, 1350-1550,'Early Book Society, Center for Medieval Studies, York University, 3-7 July 2011. 
			<br>This paper offered preliminary thoughts about mercantile book production and reading in fifteenth century York.</li>
			<li>'Historical Exegesis and reading the Psalms in Anglo Saxon England' at ''Let us go down there, and confound their language:' The Bible in Translation.' London, Birkbeck College 28 May 2011.</li>

	<h1 class="section">Teaching and Service</h1>
	<h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>ENLT : The Bible and Early English Literature, Fall 2014 (pending review)
			<br>This class explores the relationship between Biblical texts and English Literature 650-1550. Each section consists of a pair of texts, one either Canonical or from the Latin commentary tradition and one literary. The pairs are planned so as to provide methodological, chronological, and generic diversity.  Throughout the course we return to questions of textual materiality, gender, and power.</li> 
			<li>ENWR 1510: Reading and Writing about Poetry, Spring 2014
			<br>This class teaches critical writing principles via literary engagement.  It pairs specific reading and writing skills in conjunction with each other so as to emphasize the essential continuity between critical reading and critical writing. The first half of the term is spent honing traditional ‘close reading’ on canonical texts, whereas in the second half of the course students are encouraged to seek out texts of their own interest and to explore the socio-cultural aspects of poetic creation and consumption.</li>
			<li>ENWR 1510: A Knight at the Movies, Fall 2013
			</br>This course attempts to simultaneously teach critical writing skills and inculcate a cultural awareness of modern medievalisms.  The course proceeds in three units: Disney’s Sword in the Stone and King Arthur’s American Dream, Ridley Scott’s Kingdom of Heaven and The Politics of Post 9/11 Crusading and Peter Jackson’s The Two Towers: Adaptation, History, Race, Gender, and Ideology. These units prepare students to write persuasively about complex cultural and historical phenomena while also exposing them to the medieval period at an early juncture in their college career.</li> 
			<li>ENWR 3800: Advanced Academic and Professional Writing, Spring 2013
			<br>This class explores advanced principles of academic and business writing. The course is built around a project of each student’s choosing. Pedagogically, this class prioritizes collaboration and individual self discovery.</li>
			<li>ENGL 3810: English Literature from Caedmon to Milton, Fall 2012
			<br>This survey exposes English Majors—or other interested students—to wide range of Medieval and Early Modern texts as well as diverse theoretical approaches to those texts.</li>
		</ul>
	<h2>Departmental Service</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>2013-14- Interdisciplinary Undergradute Medieval Colloquium Co-Ordinator
			<br>I co-organize a weekly colloquim of undergraduate students interested in medieval studies. Some of the participants are majoring in Medieval Studies, others are writing thesis on medieval topics, and some are just interested in the period. Each week we read a short primary or secondary reading and then discuss its implications for our own work. I also organize regular material culture workshops including visits to UVA’s special collections library and the Fralin Museam.</li>
			<li>2013-14- English Graduates Organization Medieval Area Representative
			<br>I represent the medieval period to EGO (English Graduates Organization at Virginia).  In this capacity I advise offer suggestions regarding upcoming course offerings and advocate on behalf of the early periods.</li>
			<li>2013- Graduate Conference Abstracts Reviewer
			<br>I reviewed Medieval and Early Modern abstracts for the 2013 Graduate Conference at UVA.  From c. 40 abstracts I selected 12 and placed them into three panels for which I organized conveners and respondents</li>
			<li>2011- International Piers Plowman Conference Volunteer
			<br>I volunteered in several aspects of the International Piers Plowman Conference in Oxford. I assisted in preparation and registration as well as facilitating the book display during the conference.</li>
